# TradeMap - A python trading platform
Trade Map is a software that helps new traders and investors trade stocks with minimal risk.


## Project Abstract
TradeMap helps users to check price of stocks in real time. It also has the capability to show various chart types and show the moving average. Users can also perform some technical analysis at the push of a button. It will also help to give a risk/reward ratio using some metrics. There is also a plan to have a small trading platform with virtual money where users can try out their strategies without losing any real money. Sometimes stocks move very rapidly and to notify the user of such movements there will be a bot added to the program which will alert the user when the price moves below or above a certain level.
